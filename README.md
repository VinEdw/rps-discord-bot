![extended rock paper scissors diagrame](media/ultimate-rps.webp)

This bot allows you to play an extended version of rock paper scissors on your discord server.
Use the command `!rps` to initialize a game.
Use the command `!rps-diagram` to see the move diagram.

The game is inspired by this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/cauhw3/ultimate_rock_paper_scissors/).
Each move choice beats up to halfway across the circle.
The move options are the following:

- rock
- fire
- scissors
- snake
- human
- tree
- wolf
- sponge
- paper
- air
- water
- dragon
- devil
- lightning
- gun

The code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), and uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API wrapper.
